While Pods are the basic execution unit in Kubernetes, ReplicaSets and Deployments provide higher-level abstractions for managing application availability and updates.

## ReplicaSet

A ReplicaSet's purpose is simple: maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. It guarantees the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

**How it Works:**

- **Selector**: Identifies the Pods it should manage based on labels.
- **Replicas**: Specifies the desired number of Pods.
- **Template**: Defines the blueprint (Pod specification) for creating new Pods if the current count is less than desired.

If there are too many Pods matching the selector, the ReplicaSet terminates extras. If there are too few, it creates new ones based on the template.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-app-rs
  labels:
    app: my-app
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend # Selects pods with this label
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend # Ensures created pods match the selector
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

**Note**: You rarely create ReplicaSets directly. Deployments are the recommended way to manage replicated Pods, as they provide update and rollback capabilities on top of ReplicaSets.

## Deployment

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods along with ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

**Key Features:**

-   **Manages ReplicaSets**: A Deployment creates and manages ReplicaSets. When you update a Deployment (e.g., change the image), it creates a *new* ReplicaSet with the updated template and gradually scales up the new ReplicaSet while scaling down the old one.
-   **Rollouts**: Provides controlled updates using strategies like `RollingUpdate` (default) or `Recreate`.
-   **Rollbacks**: Allows reverting to previous versions of the Deployment if an update causes issues.
-   **Scaling**: Easily scale the number of replicas up or down.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # Deployment selector matches RS/Pod template labels
  template: # Pod template used by ReplicaSets created by this Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # Pods get this label
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2 # Specify the image version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Managing Deployments (`kubectl`)

```bash
# Create a deployment imperatively
kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx --replicas=2

# List deployments
kubectl get deployments
# Alias: kubectl get deploy

# Describe a deployment (shows status, strategy, ReplicaSets, events)
kubectl describe deployment my-nginx-deployment

# Scale a deployment
kubectl scale deployment my-nginx-deployment --replicas=5

# Update the image of a container in the deployment (triggers rollout)
kubectl set image deployment/my-nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1

# Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-nginx-deployment

# View rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-nginx-deployment

# Rollback to the previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-nginx-deployment

# Rollback to a specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-nginx-deployment --to-revision=2

# Delete a deployment (also deletes managed ReplicaSets and Pods)
kubectl delete deployment my-nginx-deployment
```

## Deployment Strategies

Defined in `spec.strategy.type`:

-   **`RollingUpdate`** (Default): Gradually replaces Pods from the old version with Pods from the new version, ensuring zero downtime if configured correctly. Parameters like `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` control the rollout process.
-   **`Recreate`**: Terminates all old Pods before creating new ones. Causes downtime during the update.
