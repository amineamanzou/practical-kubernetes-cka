---

Init Containers are specialized containers that run and complete before the main application containers are started within a Pod. They are used to perform setup tasks, pre-conditions checks, or initialization logic required by the primary application.

## Characteristics of Init Containers

- **Run to Completion**: Each Init Container must run and exit successfully before the next one begins.
- **Sequential Execution**: If multiple Init Containers are specified, they run one at a time in the order they are defined.
- **Pod Initialization**: If any Init Container fails to complete (e.g., exits with an error), Kubernetes restarts the Pod by rerunning the Init Containers (subject to the Pod's `restartPolicy`). The application containers will not start until all Init Containers succeed.
- **Separate Resources**: They can have their own resource limits and volume mounts, distinct from the main application containers.
- **No Service Exposure**: They do not participate in Services, as they complete before the main application is ready to serve traffic.

## Use Cases

- **Wait for Dependencies**: Wait for external services (like databases or APIs) to become available before starting the application.
- **Setup/Configuration**: Perform setup tasks like creating configuration files, setting up directories, or running database migrations.
- **Download Data**: Pre-fetch data or binaries needed by the application container.
- **Permission Setup**: Adjust file permissions on shared volumes.
- **Register with Discovery**: Register the Pod with a service discovery mechanism before the main application starts.

## Defining Init Containers

Init Containers are defined in the Pod specification under the `spec.initContainers` field, which is an array of container definitions, similar to `spec.containers`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-init-container
spec:
  # Init Containers run first, in order
  initContainers:
  - name: init-wait-for-db
    image: busybox:1.28
    # Example: Wait for a service named 'mydb-service' to be available
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb-service; do echo waiting for mydb-service; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-setup-config
    image: busybox:1.28
    # Example: Create a configuration file on a shared volume
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "config_value=123" > /etc/app-config/config.txt']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/app-config

  # Main application containers start only after all init containers succeed
  containers:
  - name: main-app-container
    image: my-application:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/app-config
      readOnly: true # App container might only need read access

  # Define the shared volume
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Troubleshooting

If a Pod is stuck in the `Init:` status, it indicates that one of its Init Containers is failing or hasn't completed.

```bash
# Describe the pod to see events and Init Container statuses
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Check logs of a specific Init Container
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <init-container-name>
```
