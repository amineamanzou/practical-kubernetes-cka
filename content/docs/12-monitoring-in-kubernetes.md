---

Monitoring is essential for understanding the health, performance, and resource consumption of a Kubernetes cluster and its applications.

## Metrics Server

The Kubernetes Metrics Server is a cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data. It collects metrics like CPU and memory usage from Kubelets on each node and exposes them through the Kubernetes API server via the Metrics API. This enables tools like `kubectl top` to display resource consumption for nodes and pods.

### Installation and Usage

To use commands like `kubectl top node` and `kubectl top pod`, the Metrics Server must be deployed in your cluster. The specific installation method can vary (e.g., applying a manifest file).

```bash
# Example usage after Metrics Server installation:

# View CPU and memory usage of nodes
kubectl top node

# View CPU and memory usage of pods
kubectl top pod

# View CPU and memory usage of pods in a specific namespace
kubectl top pod -n <namespace>
```

### Key Considerations

- **Resource Monitoring**: Regularly check resource usage to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize application performance, and plan for capacity scaling.
- **Ecosystem**: While Metrics Server provides basic resource metrics, tools like Prometheus and Grafana offer more comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and visualization capabilities.
