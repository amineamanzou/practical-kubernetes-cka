---

Kubernetes allows running multiple schedulers concurrently alongside the default `kube-scheduler`. This enables specialized scheduling logic for different sets of pods based on workload requirements or policies.

## Why Use Multiple Schedulers?

- **Specialized Logic**: Implement custom scheduling algorithms for specific types of workloads (e.g., batch jobs, stateful applications).
- **Testing**: Test new scheduling features or algorithms without impacting the default scheduler.
- **Resource Partitioning**: Dedicate schedulers to manage pods in specific namespaces or with particular resource needs.

## Deploying a Second Scheduler

A secondary scheduler is typically deployed as a Deployment within the cluster.

1.  **Build/Obtain Scheduler Binary**: You need a scheduler implementation (e.g., a compiled version of `kube-scheduler` or a custom scheduler).
2.  **Create a Deployment**: Define a Deployment manifest to run the scheduler pod.
    -   It needs appropriate RBAC permissions (ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding) to watch Pods and Nodes, and to bind Pods to Nodes.
    -   Specify a unique `schedulerName` in the command arguments (e.g., `--leader-elect-resource-name=my-custom-scheduler`).

    ```yaml
    # Example Deployment Snippet (Simplified)
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-custom-scheduler
      namespace: kube-system
      labels:
        component: scheduler
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          component: scheduler
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            component: scheduler
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: my-custom-scheduler-sa # Needs appropriate RBAC
          containers:
          - name: kube-scheduler
            image: registry.k8s.io/kube-scheduler:v1.29.0 # Use appropriate version
            command:
            - /usr/local/bin/kube-scheduler
            - --authentication-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
            - --authorization-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
            - --bind-address=0.0.0.0
            - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
            - --leader-elect=true
            # Unique name for this scheduler instance
            - --leader-elect-resource-name=my-custom-scheduler
            # Configuration might be needed depending on the scheduler
            # - --config=/etc/kubernetes/my-scheduler-config.yaml
          # Volume mounts for kubeconfig, potential config files, etc.
    ```

## Assigning Pods to Schedulers

Pods specify which scheduler should handle them using the `spec.schedulerName` field. If omitted, the default `kube-scheduler` is used.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-for-custom-scheduler
spec:
  # Assign this pod to the custom scheduler
  schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

## Verifying Scheduler Assignment

You can check which scheduler handled a pod by looking at the pod's events:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
# Look for an event like: Successfully assigned <namespace>/<pod-name> to <node-name> by scheduler <scheduler-name>
```
