Welcome to my documentation repository where I share my learning journey toward achieving the Kubernetes Administrator Certification (CKA). This knowledge base serves as both a study guide and a reference for anyone interested in Kubernetes and container orchestration.

## The CKA Certification Journey

The Kubernetes Administrator Certification (CKA) validates your knowledge and skills in managing Kubernetes clusters effectively. This documentation captures my understanding of key concepts, best practices, and operational details as I prepare for this certification.

## About the Zettelkasten Method

This documentation is structured using the Zettelkasten method, an approach to knowledge management that emphasizes:

- **Atomic notes**: Each page focuses on a single, self-contained concept.
- **Connections**: Notes link to related concepts, creating a network of knowledge.
- **Progressive building**: The knowledge base grows organically as concepts are explored.
- **Discoverability**: Ideas can be found through multiple paths and connections.

The Zettelkasten approach allows you to explore this documentation non-linearly, following your interests and making connections between related concepts.

## How to Navigate This Documentation

- Start with the fundamental concepts in each domain.
- Follow links to related topics to deepen your understanding.
- Use the search function to find specific concepts.
- Check the "See Also" sections for connections between topics.

Let's begin our Kubernetes administration journey!
